## üöÄ Getting Started

This project is divided into two main parts: the backend, developed using Django, and the frontend, developed using
React. Below you will find instructions to set up each part of the project.

### Backend Setup

The backend code is stored in the `Backend/` directory. Here's how to get started with it:

1. **Navigate to the Backend Directory**

```bash
cd Backend/
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Ensure you have Python 3.10 and Pipenv installed. Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pipenv install
```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

```bash
pipenv shell
```

4. **Setup the Database**
   Make sure MySQL is installed and running. Update the settings.py file with your database credentials, then execute:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

5. **Run the Development Server**

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Frontend Setup

The frontend code is stored in the Frontend/ directory and is built using React. Follow these steps to set up the
frontend:

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory**

```bash
cd Frontend/
```

2. **Install Node.js and npm**
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
   3.**Install Dependencies**
